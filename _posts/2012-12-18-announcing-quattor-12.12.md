title: Quattor 12.12 is out!!
category: review

We have just tagged and uploaded to the Yum repositories Quattor
12.12.  The goal of this release is to provide users with a
well-defined set of modules that are known to work together,
simplifying their update procedures and solving the integration
problems they used to suffer in the past.

The changelog is huge (it's been too long since our last release!!).
Thanks a lot to all contributors, developers, and users who have
participated in testing and making this a really good release!

From now on, we plan to release every four to six weeks.  So the next
release will be 13.01, and should happen by the end of January.  It
will contain the Yum-based SPMA, better maintained and debugged
daemons, and many more things!
