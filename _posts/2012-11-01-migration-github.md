title: Code repositories migrating to GitHub
category: news

One of the measures adopted during the last workshop was to move our
_official_ code repositories from SourceForge to
[GitHub](https://github.com/quattor).

All the maintained and live code is already ready, with the only
exceptions of Aquilon and the Grid-specific configuration modules.  We
will decide their future as soon as possible.

All the developers in the workshop were extremely pleased by the ease
of use of GitHub.  We hope this will allow easier sharing and better
code reviews.
