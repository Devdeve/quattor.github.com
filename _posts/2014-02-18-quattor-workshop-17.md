Registration is open for the [17th Quattor workshop](http://indico.cern.ch/event/296548/) which will take place 17-19 March 2014 at NIKHEF in Amsterdam.

Workshops are mainly focused on at steering the development of Quattor but of course all are welcome, if you are interested please join us, we're friendly!

If you are planning to attend and haven't done so already, please register sooner rather than later.
Registration helps ensure there we have a big enough room and more importantly, that there is food and coffee for everyone.

We currently have a rough draft agenda, please feel free to suggest talks, sessions and alterations.
