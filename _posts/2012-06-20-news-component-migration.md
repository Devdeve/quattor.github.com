You have probably noticed that some components are no longer in
Subversion. Where did they go?

Easy. We are migrating gradually to a new infrastructure, with Git for
version control and Maven as the build system.

All core components will gradually appear in
[the Sourceforge Git repository](git://quattor.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/quattor/core-ncm-components).
