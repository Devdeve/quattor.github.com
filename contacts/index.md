Quattor is developed and supported entirely by the community that uses it, there are no full-time paid developers.

We encourage everyone to get involved in the Quattor community and we're eager to help you out!

We can be found on the following mailing lists:

* [quattor-discuss] &mdash; Where we discuss general questions and help each other fix problems.
* [quattor-devel] &mdash; Covering issues relating to core code, libraries and the development process.

All our code and documentation (including this website) is hosted on GitHub, if you find bugs or things that could be improved, please open an issue and/or pull request on GitHub.
If you're not sure which repository to open the issue again (there are a lot) please ask!
