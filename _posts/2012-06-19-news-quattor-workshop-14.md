The 14th Quattor Workshop will be held in Gent, Belgium from 29-31
October 2012.  The core of the workshop will center on interactions
between the Quattor developers on coming improvements.  However, there
may be a section reserved for direct interactions with users and
tutorials.  Feel free to suggest topics on the Quattor discussion
list.
